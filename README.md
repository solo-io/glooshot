## Summary

- [**Using Gloo Shot**](#using-gloo)
- [**What makes Gloo Shot unique**](#what-makes-gloo-unique)


## Using Gloo Shot
- **Harden your mesh**: Gloo Shot allows you to test failure modes before they occur in production.
- **Preview architectural changes**: Real deployments have different performance characteristics than your production environment. Gloo Shot allows you to simulate your productionn environment (latency, faults, etc.) prior to deployment.


## What makes Gloo Shot unique
- **Integration with the most popular service meshes**: Gloo Shot was designed for service mesh environments. It leverages [Supergloo](https://supergloo.solo.io/) for a consistent interface to multiple different service meshes.
