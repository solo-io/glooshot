### UpstreamSpec

 
Upstream Spec for Consul Upstreams
consul Upstreams represent a set of one or more addressable pods for a consul Service
the Gloo consul Upstream maps to a single service port. Because consul Services support multiple ports,
Gloo requires that a different upstream be created for each port
consul Upstreams are typically generated automatically by Gloo from the consul API

```yaml
"serviceName": string
"serviceTags": []string
"serviceSpec": .plugins.gloo.solo.io.ServiceSpec
"connectEnabled": bool

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `serviceName` | `string` | The name of the Consul Service |  |
| `serviceTags` | `[]string` | The list of service tags Gloo should search for on a service instance before deciding whether or not to include the instance as part of this upstream |  |
| `serviceSpec` | [.plugins.gloo.solo.io.ServiceSpec](../../service_spec.proto.sk#servicespec) | An optional Service Spec describing the service listening at this address |  |
| `connectEnabled` | `bool` | is this consul service connect enabled. |  |
