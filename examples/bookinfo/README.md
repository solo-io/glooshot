# Book info sample app 

This app has been adapted from [Istio's sample app](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples/bookinfo)


# Summary of changes

Some of the images in `bookinfo.yaml` have been adapted for the testing needs of Glooshot.

Changes are summarized below.

## reviews v4: Propagation of failure in review service

- purpose:
   - example of a non-robust service: it produces 500's when one of the services that it interacts with produces a bad response.
- description:
  - failures in requests from the review service to the rating service produce failures (`500` responses) in requests from the product page to the review page

- diagram:
  - `product` <-a-> `reviews:v4` <-b-> `ratings`
  - condition: no faults
    - description: weak point is "hidded" (not expressed)
    - result: reviews service behaves in same manner as `reviews:v3`
  - condition: fault in route `b`
    - description: weak point is expressed, cascading failure results
    - result: error is propagated to route `a`
    - preferred behavior: the `reviews` service should be able to provide a valid response even if it encounters errors from the `ratings` service

# Tutorial: Demonstrate a cascading failure

**NOTE - The supergloo commands below will be replaced with glooshot commands***

There are two ways to use this demo, either with the helper script `demo.sh` or by passing the full commands yourself.

## With helper script
- follow the steps below, as ordered, calling `./demo.sh <command>` for command=watch-pods, 1, 2, etc.
- you will need 3 terminals to complete all these steps since there are two long-running processes
- **Suggestion**, open `demo.sh` to read along as you call these commands
```bash
    "watch-pods") ## watch pods transition between states
    "1") ## [open new terminal] initialize supergloo
    "2") ## deploy istio
    "3") ## label namespace for injection
    "4") ## deploy bookinfo sample applicaiton
    "forward") ## port forward to http://localhost:9080
    "5") ## [open a new terminal] send all traffic to the "weak" version of the app, reviews:v4 (verify: stars are always red)
    "6") ##"preview-failure" Observe the "worst case" failure, Expect to see: "Error fetching product reviews!"
    "7") ##"preview-failure-cleanup" Remove the fault that causes the "worst case" failure, Expect stars to have returned
    "8") ## Triger the weakness (make failure between reviews and ratings) and note that it produces the "worst-case" failure - Expect to see failure between product and reviews
    "9") ## Deploy a more robust version of the reviews app and note that despite the fault, we avoid the "worst-case" failure - Expect the reviews to show up and smaller error: "Ratings service is currently unavailable"
```

## Without helper script
### Initial setup
- note that the reviews and ratings are shown
```bash
supergloo init
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
supergloo install istio --name istio --installation-namespace istio-system --mtls=true --auto-inject=true
kubectl apply -f bookinfo.yaml
supergloo apply routingrule trafficshifting \
    --name reviews-v4 \
    --dest-upstreams supergloo-system.default-reviews-9080 \
    --target-mesh supergloo-system.istio \
    --destination supergloo-system.default-reviews-v4-9080:1
kubectl port-forward -n default deployment/productpage-v1 9080
## OPEN localhost:9080 in your browser - see the "baseline" app
```

### What does it look like when `reviews` fail
- note that neither reviews nor ratings are shown
```bash
supergloo apply routingrule faultinjection abort http \
    --target-mesh supergloo-system.istio \
     -p 100 -s 500  --name fault-product-to-reviews \
    --dest-upstreams supergloo-system.default-reviews-9080
## RELOAD PAGE - Expect error from reviews
# cleanup:
kubectl delete routingrule -n supergloo-system fault-product-to-reviews
## RELOAD PAGE - Expect errors to have gone away
```

### Trigger the weakness
- note, again, that neither reviews nor ratings are shown
```bash
supergloo apply routingrule faultinjection abort http \
    --target-mesh supergloo-system.istio \
     -p 100 -s 500  --name fault-reviews-to-ratings \
    --dest-upstreams supergloo-system.default-ratings-9080
## RELOAD PAGE - Expect reviews to fail in the same manner
```

### Replace the weak service with a more robust version
- note that reviews show without ratings
```bash
kubectl delete routingrule -n supergloo-system reviews-v4
supergloo apply routingrule trafficshifting \
    --name reviews-v3 \
    --dest-upstreams supergloo-system.default-reviews-9080 \
    --target-mesh supergloo-system.istio \
    --destination supergloo-system.default-reviews-v3-9080:1
## RELOAD PAGE - Expect failure to be more graceful, reviews information is shown without the ratings
```
